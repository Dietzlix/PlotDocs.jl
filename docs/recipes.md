# Recipes

Like other tools in Plots, recipes are relatively simple, but extremely powerful.  A recipe is created by invoking the `@recipe` macro, which is defined in the lightweight package [RecipesBase](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/RecipesBase.jl).  There are many examples of recipes both within Plots and in many external packages, including [PlotRecipes](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/PlotRecipes.jl).
